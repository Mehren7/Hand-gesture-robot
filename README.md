# Hand-gesture-robot
A hand gesture-controlled robot enables intuitive movement control through a wired interface using MEMS sensors such as accelerometers or 
gyroscopes. These sensors detect hand gestures, which are processed by a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and transmitted via wires to guide the 
robot’s motion—forward, backward, left, or right. 
  
This setup reduces the need for traditional remotes or a second operator, allowing direct real-time control of the robot through natural hand 
movements. This system is ideal for hazardous tasks, educational purposes, and research, offering an intuitive interface, real-time response, and 
adaptability across platforms.
